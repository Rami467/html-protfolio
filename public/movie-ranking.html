<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Harry Potter Movies</h3>
<p>I really love the Harry Potter movies because they bring a whole magical world to life. I grew up watching them, and I still enjoy how each movie gets darker and more emotional as the story goes on. The characters feel real, and the friendship between them is something I’ve always liked. The music, magic, and all the small details make it special. That’s why I picked Harry Potter for my movie ranking project!</p>
<h3>BAY WATCH </h3>
<p>I like Baywatch because it’s fun to watch and has a mix of action, comedy, and beach vibes. The story isn’t too serious, but it’s entertaining, and I like how the characters work together as a team. The movie has a good balance between humor and rescue scenes, and it always gives off a cool summer feeling. It’s one of those movies I can watch anytime and still enjoy.</p>
<h3>El CAMINO</h3>
<p>I really liked El Camino because it gave a perfect ending to Jesse Pinkman’s story from Breaking Bad. The movie has the same dark and intense feeling as the show, and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. I liked how it showed Jesse trying to find peace after everything he went through. The acting, music, and storytelling were all amazing. It felt like the closure fans were waiting for.</p>
